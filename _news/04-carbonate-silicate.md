title: Our discovery of a metastable calcium silicon double carbonate has been published in Angewandte Chemie!
description: >-
  This article reports the synthesis of a calcium silicon double
  carbonate synthesized at high pressure (39.5 GPa) and high
  temperature (2600 K). The structure is unique, with
  sixfold-coordinated Si sharing oxygen atoms with carbonate groups,
  and is metastable at ambient conditions.
