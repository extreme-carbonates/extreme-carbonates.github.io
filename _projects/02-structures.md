This research line aims to study the phase stability and physical
properties of minerals and metals under extreme conditions of pressure
and temperature. Such conditions (up to 2 Mbar and 6000K), similar to
those existing inside the Earth are produced in the laboratory using
table-top techniques (high-power lasers, diamond cells,...) and
state-of-the-art computational approaches.

In particular, we are interested in:

- Structural systematics in high-pressure solid-solid phase
  transitions in ABO<sub>4</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>BO<sub>4</sub> and
  A<sub>2</sub>S mineral families. Discovery of novel dense
  polymorphs.

- Determination of equilibrium and thermodynamical properties of
  metals under conditions of deep Earth mantle and core, with special
  emphasis on melting phenomena.
