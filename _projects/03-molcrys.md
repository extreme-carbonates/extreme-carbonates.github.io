Our research group is interested in the study of molecular
materials. There several research topics we are currently working on: 

- Development of methods for the computational modeling of molecular
  materials and intermolecular interactions in general.
  
- Development of computer software for the description of these
  materials.
  
- Molecular crystal structure prediction and phase diagram prediction.

- Calculation of thermodynamic properties and temperature modeling in
  molecular crystals.
