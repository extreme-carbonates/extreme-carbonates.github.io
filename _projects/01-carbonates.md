This project has 2 research lines:

- Structural stability of CO2 and carbonates under pressure and
temperature conditions of the Earth's interior. The behavior of
carbonate minerals under pressure will also account for the importance
of chemical substitution in compositionally complex systems, such as
those existing in the Earth's interior. Implications in
geophysics.

- High pressure and high temperature carbon dioxide chemistry.
This line includes both (i) the study of the reactivity between carbon
dioxide and metals and (ii) obtaining data in adsorption processes of
CO2 in zeolites (number and location of adsorbed CO2 molecules, and
the nature of the trapping). Implications for CO2 capture and
storage.
